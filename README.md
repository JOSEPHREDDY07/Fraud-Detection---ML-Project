# Fraud-Detection---ML-Project
Fraud Detection - ML Project

In this Project we will determine fraud by using data. 
1.Applying supervised learning algorithms to detect fraudulent behavior based upon past fraud.
2.Use unsupervised learning methods to discover new types of fraud activities. 
3.Fraud detection using text data - augment your fraud detection models with text mining and topic modelling.
